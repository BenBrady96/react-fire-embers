## ✨ Features

### Core Animation
- 🔥 **Rising Sparks** — 50 particles float upward from the bottom of the screen like embers from a campfire
- 💨 **Erratic Drift** — Each spark follows a unique randomised horizontal drift path with 5 waypoints
- ✨ **Realistic Flicker** — Fast step-based flicker animation toggles between bright and dim glow states
- 🎨 **Dynamic Colour** — Each particle gets a unique hue (warm yellows to deep oranges) and glow intensity

### Technical
- ⚡ **Pure CSS Animations** — No canvas, no WebGL, no JavaScript animation loops
- 🪶 **Lightweight** — Zero external animation dependencies
- 📱 **Responsive** — Full viewport coverage, works on any screen size
- 🚫 **Non-intrusive** — `pointer-events: none` overlay, doesn't interfere with page interaction

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Particle Properties

Each of the 50 sparks is randomly generated with the following ranges:

| Property | Range | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Size | 1.5–4.5px | Small bright points |
| Rise Duration | 4–8s | Time to float from bottom to top |
| Drift Duration | 1–2.5s | Horizontal sway cycle speed |
| Flicker Duration | 0.1–0.4s | Brightness toggle speed |
| Hue | 15°–50° | Warm yellow to deep orange |
| Lightness | 55%–75% | Brightness variation |
| Drift Range | ±40px | Horizontal movement per waypoint |

### Customising

Edit `src/FireEmbers.jsx` to adjust:
- **Particle count** — Change `length: 50` to your preferred count
- **Colour range** — Modify the `hue` and `lightness` calculations
- **Speed** — Adjust `riseDuration`, `driftDuration`, and `flickerDuration` ranges
- **Drift intensity** — Change the `* 80` multiplier in `driftRange`

### How It Works

1. **On mount**, `FireEmbers` generates 50 particle objects with randomised properties
2. Each particle is rendered as a tiny `<div>` with CSS custom properties (`--rise-duration`, `--drift-left`, etc.)
3. **Three layered CSS animations** run simultaneously on each particle:
   - `spark-rise` — vertical movement from bottom to top
   - `spark-drift` — horizontal sway through 5 random waypoints
   - `spark-flicker` — rapid brightness/glow toggling
4. All animation is handled by the browser's compositor — **zero JavaScript runs per frame**
